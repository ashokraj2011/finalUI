# WRK-456 — Verification Evidence

## Commands and environment

- Repository: /Users/ashokraj/Downloads/testSF/Rule-ux-ui/repos/ruleengineui
- Branch: WRK-456
- Verification commands run:
  - `python3 -m json.tool singularity/world-model/manifest.json > /dev/null`
  - `python3 -m json.tool singularity/world-model/core/model.json > /dev/null`
  - `python3 -m json.tool singularity/world-model/index/path-map.json > /dev/null`
  - `find singularity/world-model -type f | sort`
  - `npm run build`
- Outcome: the world-model JSON files parsed successfully and the expected world-model files were present. The Angular build did not complete because the local Node dependencies for the Angular build toolchain were not installed (`@angular-devkit/build-angular:application` missing).

## Acceptance and specification results

- AC-001: Confirmed. The intake artifact explicitly limits the change to artifact generation and documentation, and the implementation work stayed inside the governed world-model area.
- AC-002: Confirmed. The verification evidence references repository grounding files under singularity/world-model and the observed source paths in src/app and server/ without asserting unsupported product behavior.
- AC-003: Confirmed. The change did not modify application source files under src/app/ or server/; only world-model artifacts and manifest files were added and published.

## Negative, regression, security, and non-functional checks

- Negative/regression: No application code paths were changed, so there were no source-level regressions introduced by this chore.
- Security: The verification scope did not identify authentication or authorization implementation in the visible source; the security grounding artifact records that as an observed gap rather than an assumption.
- Non-functional: The build verification could not be completed in this environment because the required Angular build packages were not available. This is an environmental blocker rather than a functional failure in the submitted artifact work.

# WRK-456 — Implementation Summary

## Implemented outcome

Completed the repository-world-model grounding work for this chore without changing application source files. The implementation phase produced a grounded world-model bundle under the repository’s governed world-model directory, including core summary content, development/testing views, a business view, a domain note for rule testing, and a task guide for the current objective.

## Changed components and decisions

- Added and published world-model artifacts under singularity/world-model, including core summary/model files, manifest, path index, evidence ledger, and view documents for development, testing, and business.
- Registered the testing and business views in the world-model manifest so the governed workflow can resolve required views during implementation and verification phases.
- Kept application source files under src/app and server unchanged; the work remained artifact-only and repository-grounding focused.

## Tests and operational notes

- Verified the generated world-model bundle structure and manifest references by re-running the governed workflow checks and confirming that the required world-model files were present.
- The implementation artifact is intended to support downstream verification and conformance work for the current repository-grounding task.
- No application runtime or build commands were required for this chore because the change was limited to governed documentation and world-model artifacts.

# WRK-456 — Chore Intake

## Objective

Maintain the repository-grounding workflow for this chore by producing an evidence-backed intake artifact for WRK-456 that explains the task outcome, scope, and validation approach without changing application source files. The intent is to support downstream world-model generation for the Angular UI shell, rule-engine services, and Express API using observed repository structure and behavior.

## Scope and validation

### Confirmed needs
- REQ-001: Document the maintenance outcome for the current task using evidence from the Angular application shell, rule-engine services, and API entry points.
- REQ-002: Keep the change artifact-only and avoid editing application source files; generated material should remain under the repository’s output and world-model areas.
- REQ-003: Capture relevant business context from the visible rule-authoring workflow, glossary persistence, and validator experience.

### Proposed approach
- Use the repository grounding materials and visible source files as the evidence base, including src/app/app.component.ts, src/app/services/rule-store.service.ts, src/app/services/rule-engine.service.ts, and server/index.js.
- Write the intake artifact with a concise objective, explicit scope boundaries, and validation criteria that can be used to publish the phase and continue the workflow.

### Validation
- AC-001: The intake artifact clearly states the maintenance outcome and explicitly limits the change to artifact generation and documentation.
- AC-002: The artifact references repository evidence paths and avoids assumptions about product intent beyond the observed sample rules and glossary data.
- AC-003: The published phase should be consistent with the repository grounding outputs and should not introduce application code changes.

### Exclusions
- No changes to application source files in src/app/ or server/.
- No assumptions about production policy sources or deployment topology beyond the repository evidence available in the current checkout.

### Unresolved questions
- The repository contains sample rules and glossary data but does not define a production approval workflow or authoritative policy source; that should be confirmed by the product owner before broader policy changes.
